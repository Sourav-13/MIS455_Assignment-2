                <h1>Meredith Grey</h1>
                <p>
                    *Swift's first famous cat is a Scottish Fold named Meredith Grey (yes, she is named after Meredith Grey of Grey's Anatomy). The pop star got Meredith in 2011.<br>
                    *The kitten has always had a special place in Swift's heart. "She is awesome. She's, like, the most adorable cat in the world," the singer said not long after bringing her home.<br>
                    *Their relationship, however, is not one-sided — Swift has a loyal fan in Meredith. In 2012, when her then-new single, "I Knew You Were Trouble," was playing on the radio, Swift filmed Meredith meowing along to the song. <br>
                    *Meredith has made several appearances on Swift's Instagram and is a bit of a star in her own right as well. Look closely throughout Deadpool 2 to spot Meredith: she appears in a t-shirt Ryan Reynolds' character wears in the film, which shows Meredith and her sister Olivia Benson sitting side-by-side with the words, "Olivia & Meredith Best Friends Purrrrr-Ever." 
                    The Scottish Fold also appeared in Swift's "ME!" music video with Panic! At the Disco.<br>
                    *That said, Meredith might be Swift's most reclusive cat. In 2020, Swift encouraged her fans to self-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic with a cute photo of Meredith sitting in a toy, barely visible. In a tweet, the pop star wrote, "For Meredith, self quarantining is a way of life. Be like Meredith."

                <h1>Olivia Benson</h1>
                <p>
                    *Swift brought her second cat, Olivia Benson, home in 2014. Olivia is another Scottish Fold named after a TV character — she gets her moniker from Mariska Hargitay's character on Law & Order: SVU.<br>
                        *In 2015, Olivia even got the chance to meet her namesake. Swift shared a video of the white kitten cuddling up to Hargitay as she knelt down to feed her. "This is Olivia Benson meeting Olivia Benson, and um, things are going well so far," she said in the video. <br>
                        *Like Meredith, Olivia is a bit of a star. She also appeared in Deadpool 2 and in the "ME!" music video. In 2017, Olivia had her own moment in the spotlight when she was featured in an outtake from an AT&T ad campaign with Swift. In the video, which Swift posted to her Instagram, 
                        the singer crawls across the floor and asks Olivia, "Are you a saber-toothed tiger cub? Are you my baby wolverine? Are you Princess of Meow Town? 
                        Are you just a melting snowman? Are you just a sloth? 'Cause you're just a little unicorn kitty cat!" <br>
                        *Olivia has also joined her mom in a Diet Coke ad. In the clip, Swift plays with the cat while she drinks a can of soda — but every time she takes a sip, more cats appear to surround Olivia.<br>
